// Package gocqlx is a productivity toolkit for ScyllaDB and Apache CassandraÂ®.
// It's an extension of `gocql`, similar to what `sqlx` is to `database/sql`.
//
// It contains wrappers over gocql types that provide convenience methods which
// are useful in the development of database driven applications. Under the
// hood it uses sqlx/reflectx package so sqlx models will also work with gocqlx.
